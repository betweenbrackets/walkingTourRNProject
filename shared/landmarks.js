            description: 'But its on the very top floor, accessible only through a museum tour, that you really come face-to-face with the dreams of those early Asian Seattlites who spent their life savings on steamer journeys to the United States in hopes of a better life. Behind a fire door plated with flattened tin cans, lie rooms rented to new arrivals for about 25 cents a week. Bare and not much bigger than the iron frame beds inside, they’re kept in original condition with gas and wood stoves, World War II artifacts, gray wool blankets and a sense of hard work and hope that’s almost tangible. A large room used by the Gee How Oak Tin Chinese family association sports a pressed tin ceiling and embroidered table runner; next door are rooms with vintage ivory Mahjongg pieces and betting tables.'

            description: 'First up is Canton Alley, which runs beside the Wing and housed many early immigrants from China. The alley’s a shadow of its former bustling self, as photographs show: Only one apartment is still inhabited and one business (selling lanterns, karate cards and other Chinese tchotchkes) still in operation. But at number 6, the tour guide will let you into another private part of the Wing: The apartment Ford gave to the fictional family of Henry Lee. The window has a shelf for displaying Henry’s parents’ trades, the kitchen is windowless and opens onto a tiny bathroom; upstairs bedrooms are surprisingly big and airy, with a desk by the window where Henry did his homework for the school where he was bullied as the only nonwhite kid.'
